This is a Vite React + shadcn project. No .env or environment files are supported in this environment.

# React Dev Guidelines

## Always
- Make sure the UI is styled and looks great
- Create responsive designs
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use shadcn/ui components. useToast is defined in src/hooks/use-toast.ts
- Show toast notifications for important events
- Consider user requirements for fonts and color palettes when creating new apps
- Ensure the app has a modern, beautiful appearance with cohesive and fitting colors and fonts
- Design with purpose and focus on core functionality first
- Use `text-foreground` (not `text-white`) for the outline variety buttons
- String quotation rule: Never use single quotes for strings containing apostrophes as it breaks the string (e.g., 'Bachelor's degree' is wrong). Instead, use double quotes for strings with apostrophes ("Bachelor's degree"), single quotes for strings without apostrophes ('No apostrophes here'), and backticks for template literals (`With ${variables}`).

## Don't
- Add try/catch blocks unless requested
- Add dark mode unless requested
- Over-engineer solutions with unnecessary UI elements (like navigation bars or footers) unless specifically needed for the app's core functionality
- Add complex features that weren't requested by the user
